# Overview

In light of some of the recent `npm` security issues [[1]](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175824896885/incident-report-npm-inc-operations-incident-of) [[2]](https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes), this document looks to show how we're looking to address some of the issues with installing dependencies from a live registry by taking advantage of [Yarn's offline feature](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/offline-mirror/). The majority of steps taken are inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/leeb/status/1017607265115750400) from Lee Byron.

# Continuous Integration

We specify a `.yanrc` file in this project that sets the path for Yarn's offline mirror to the folder `.yarn-offline-mirror`. This folder contains all the tarballs for the packages that the project uses. What this allows us to do is run `yarn install --offline` in our Continuous Integration environment so that we don't have to fetch from the live registry in our builds.

# FAQ

## How do I install a dependency?

When installing a dependency, you can just do `yarn add <dependency-name>` as normal. The only difference now is that you also will check in the corresponding tarball entry in `.yarn-offline-mirror` as well so that we don't have to fetch this dependency from the live registry during Continuous Integration builds.
